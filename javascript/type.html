<!-- A simple typwriter in javascript, it is not for everyone but i think some can learn from it,
the logic is, start typing a text, when it's done call eraser to erase the text, and if eraser is done erasing the text and there is still another text in the store, repeat the steps for that text. see the code below, -->

function $(selector){
        return document.querySelector(selector);

       const p = $('#typeWriter');

       const text = [
         'hello how are you doing',
         'so happy to hear you are fine',
       'this is a simple typewriter'
          ];
    //x is the text pointer, it is 0 meaning it is the in the beginning of the text
     //we are to type
        let x = 0;
   //d is a pointer pointing to the text we want to type, it is 0 meaning we are
  // going to be typing the first text in the store.

  //activeText is the text we are typing now
       let activeTxt = text[d]

   //if not end of text start typing else wait for some time and then erase 
  //the text
           if(x > activeTxt.length) {
             setTimeout(erase,wait);  } else {

          if(x < 0) {
       //if x < 0 means we have finish erasing the text.
      //then we check if the text we just finish  typing and erasing is the last
     // text in the store, if it is, we move to the first text, if not we go to the 
     //next text in the store
  //we do this by moving the pointer to the text forward or taking it to the first
